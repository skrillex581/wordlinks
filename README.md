I'm redoing my python-wordladder app. You will notice very quickly that this is just one huge hack as I try to find the time to work out my thoughts and put everything to code -- one stumbling step at a time.
# Install instructions
I use `pythonvirtualenv` so install that, then do a `pip install -r requirements.txt` to get the required libraries.
